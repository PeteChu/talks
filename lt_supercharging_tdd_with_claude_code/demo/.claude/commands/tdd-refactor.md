**Blue Phase - TDD Refactoring**

**Input**

test_suite_file: $ARGUMENTS

**Description**
Refactors code to improve structure, readability, and performance while maintaining all passing tests in the TDD Blue phase.

**Context**
We are focusing on the TDD (Test-Driven Development) cycle, specifically the
"Blue" phase. You're given a test suite with passing tests (test_suite_file). Your task is to
refactor the implementation code to improve its quality while ensuring that
all tests continue to pass.

**Instructions**

1. **Verify Current State**: Run the test suite to confirm all tests pass

2. **Analyze Code Quality**: Review the implementation for:

   - Code duplication (DRY principle)
   - Complex or unclear logic
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Poor naming or structure
   - Missing abstractions

3. **Refactor Safely**: Improve the code by:

   - **Extracting methods/functions** for repeated code
   - **Renaming variables/functions** for clarity
   - **Simplifying complex conditionals**
   - **Optimizing algorithms** where beneficial
   - **Improving code organization** and structure

4. **Maintain Green State**: After each refactoring step:
   - Run tests to ensure they still pass
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Never break existing functionality

## Refactoring Targets

- **Structure**: Better organization and separation of concerns
- **Readability**: Clearer variable names and simpler logic
- **Performance**: More efficient algorithms or data structures
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify

## Key Principles

- **Keep tests passing** at all times
- **Small incremental changes** rather than big rewrites
- **Focus on internal quality** without changing external behavior
- **Test-driven confidence** - tests protect against regression
