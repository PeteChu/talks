# Credit Card Form Input Validation Requirements

## Overview

We need to build input validation for a credit card payment form to ensure data quality and security before processing payments.

## Basic Requirements

### Card Number Validation

- Accept major credit card types (Visa, MasterCard, American Express)
- Remove spaces and dashes from input
- Validate using appropriate algorithm
- Length should be reasonable for credit cards

### Expiry Date Validation

- Format: MM/YY
- Should not accept expired cards
- Month should be valid (1-12)

### CVV Validation

- 3 digits for most cards
- Different length for some card types
- Should be numeric only

### Cardholder Name

- Allow letters and spaces
- Reasonable length limits

## Security Considerations

- Prevent malicious input
- No special characters where not appropriate
- Validate data format before processing

## Notes

- This will handle user input before sending to payment processor
- Focus on preventing invalid data and basic security
- Performance is important for good user experience
